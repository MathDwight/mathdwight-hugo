That's me on the left: I'm an incoming postdoc research associate at Iowa State University preparing to work with [Michael Young](https://orion.math.iastate.edu/myoung/) on [challenging and improving graduate math programs](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920753&HistoricalAwards=false) and with [Jonas Hartwig](http://jthartwig.net/) exploring (super)algebraic structures and their physical applications. My PhD was completed at The University of Texas at Arlington under the advisement of [Dimitar Grantcharov](http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/grandim/) in the areas of [Lie superalgebras](files/DictionaryOnLieSuperalgebras_Frappat.pdf#defLiesuper) and [representation theory](http://math.mit.edu/research/pure/representation.php).
<!--See my [vita](https://mathdwight.com/files/DWilliamsII_CV_2020.pdf) for progress in this journey.--> <br>
On the right is [my mentor Dr. Roselyn Williams](http://famu.edu/index.cfm?math&RoselynPublication) in Denver for JMM 2020! She's amazing!
